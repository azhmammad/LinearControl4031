# Linear Control Systems: Homework, Projects, and Notes
Welcome to the Linear Control Systems Repository! This repository is a collection of all the homework assignments, projects, and notes compiled during the Linear Control Systems semester. Whether you're a fellow student, a curious learner, or a seasoned professional revisiting the fundamentals, this repository is designed to provide valuable insights into one of the core areas of engineering and applied mathematics.
# ✨ About Linear Control Systems
Linear Control Systems have been a cornerstone of engineering since the early 20th century. They form the foundation for modern automation, robotics, and feedback systems. A control system is responsible for managing, commanding, directing, or regulating the behavior of dynamic systems.

The journey of linear control systems began with James Clerk Maxwell's groundbreaking work in control theory, followed by the development of tools like the Laplace Transform and advancements in state-space analysis. Today, control systems are indispensable in technologies ranging from autopilot in aircraft to temperature regulation in smart homes.

In this semester, we explored the principles and practices of:

- System modeling and representation (Transfer functions, Block diagrams, Signal flow graphs)
- Time-domain and frequency-domain analysis (Stability, transient, and steady-state behavior)
- Root locus, Bode plots, and Nyquist diagrams for stability and performance evaluation
- Controller design (PID controllers, compensators, state feedback, and pole placement)
